When I was young, my parents realised one way to keep me occupied in restaurants was to give me pens, pencils or anything that made a mark and get me to sketch. Years later, I decided &mdash; rather than attempt to become a fully-fledged artist &mdash; I would study history of art at university. After graduating, I tried to get a job in advertising and eventually got an account executive role at a digital communications agency. 

In the years that followed, I worked in various roles &mdash; including digital content editing, search engine optimisation and UX/front-end development-adjacent positions.  

I was lucky enough to have been around for the sea change that was the move to responsive web design and worked on several significant website re-designs including the complete rebuild of two separate websites for the insurance company AXA. 

In recent years I was Digital Transformation Manager for the municipally-owned Bristol Energy. 

While each role has its unique challenges, a constant throughout my career has been a fascination with communication through words and images, digital systems and interfaces and how we can use design for 'good'. 

I now work exclusively in accessibility and inclusion as Principal Accessibility Consultant at <a href="https://www.nomensa.com/">Nomensa</a> &mdash; a strategic experience design agency based in Bristol, United Kingdom.
