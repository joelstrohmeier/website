# An ode to Harry Oram

<p>I’m sorry.</p> 
<p>I’m sorry you weren’t always understood.</p>
<p>I’m sorry when I kept you at a distance.</p> 
<p>I’m sorry you didn’t always feel loved.</p> 
<p>I’m sorry we didn’t laugh more.</p>
<p>I’m sorry I didn’t paint with you.</p>
<p>I’m sorry if I didn’t thank you more: you did so much for me.</p> 
<p>I’m sorry when I made you self-conscious.</p>  
<p>I’m sorry I was awkward when you tried stand-up.</p>  
<p>I’m sorry systems and expectations conspired to fuck you. I’m sorry about this… again.</p>
<p>I’m sorry you won’t watch the boys grow older. I ache with sorry – a searing sorry.</p> 
<p>I’m sorry I didn't see you needed more, better from me.</p>
<hr>
<p>I’m not sorry how original you were.</p> 
<p>I’m not sorry how much you loved Hannah.</p>
<p>I’m not sorry how much you loved, and were proud, of the boys.</p>
<p>I’m not sorry for all the times we shared – brilliant, beautiful times.</p>
<p>I’m not sorry you lived with a brave vulnerability.</p>  
<p>I’m not sorry you entrusted me with your dreams and fears.</p>
<p>I’m not sorry about our many, many table tennis games.</p>
<p>I promise to look after Hannah, the boys and your memory.</p> 

<p>Love, Joel.</p>
