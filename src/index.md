<h1>Thoughts on accessibility, inclusion and experience design.</h1>

<img class="headshot" src="/images/picture-of-me.jpeg" alt="Mid-length shot of me presenting - showing head, upper body and the very top of my arms. The camera has captured me slightly from the side - such that I look downwards and to the right, rather than toward the viewer. I am wearing a blue and black polo shirt and glasses which have both clear and tortoiseshell detail. In the background, a purple event banner can be seen but is not in focus.">

Hello. I'm an accessibility specialist with a background in: digital, design and experience which spans over 15 years. 

I like switching between big, abstract, holistic problems as much as getting into the details and fixing things. 

I always look to learn from the disciplines around me. I'm particularly interested in the overlap between accessibility and: service design, content design and, brand strategy.  

## Work

I've led work with NHS Test and Trace, Zurich, British Airways, Booking.com and Transport for Greater Manchester, to name a few organisations. While at NHS Test and Trace, I helped establish the processes and standards for digital accessibility across the programme.
