<h1>Thoughts on accessibility, inclusion and experience design.</h1>

Hello. I'm an accessibility specialist with a background in: digital, design and experience which spans over 11 years. 

I tend to switch between thinking about big holistic ideas and getting into the details and fixing things. 

I donâ€™t work based on a limited view of accessibility and always seek ways to learn from other disciplines. I'm particularly interested in the overlap between accessibility and: service design, content design and, increasingly, brand strategy.  

## Work

I've led work with NHS Test and Trace, Zurich, British Airways, Booking.com and Transport for Greater Manchester. While at NHS Test and Trace, I helped establish the processes and standards for digital accessibility across the programme.
