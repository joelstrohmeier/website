  <h1>Start learning about accessibility: part 1</h1>
<p>How do you start learning about accessibility? The topic is broader than it might first seem and is often misunderstood. At its core, it's simple. It's about people -- in particular, people with disabilities -- and making sure the things we design and build don't prevent people with disability from getting on with their lives.</p>
<p>In this blog -- Part 1 -- we're looking at the definition of accessibility, who accessibility benefits and how some tools and techniques people with disabilities might use when interacting with your product or service.</p>
<h2>What does the word accessibility mean?</h2>
<p>A friend of mine introduced me to the following explanation, which I love:</p>
<p>[accessibility is about] making sure someone is not blocked from completing a task or achieving a goal as a result of <em>experiencing</em> disability.</p>
<p>Terms change but this definition still seems to work -- in that 'accessibility' focusses on disability and impairment whereas 'inclusion' is broader in scope. Inclusion considers how someone's: race, religion, gender, socio-economic background and other protected characteristics affect experience.</p>
<p>Another way to think about accessibility is that it can be thought of as a measure of the quality of design -- it is a measure of how usable something is for people with disabilities. Inclusive design how we approach building those experiences.</p>
<p>We shouldn't get too distracted by definitions. The important thing is that there is a work to be done on removing barriers to products and services and it requires both accessibility and inclusion. Not one or the other.</p>
<p>As you read and learn more, you'll probably notice similarities between the how user experience and accessibility as disciplines are described and how they applied in the real world. That's expected. User experience and accessibility both want to improve the experiences of people. It's just that accessibility traditionally focusses on a sub-set of people.</p>

</ul>
<h2>Accessibility and disability</h2>
<p>Accessibility is about considering how products and services can be used by people with:</p>
<ul>
<li>limited / no vision</li>
<li>limited / no hearing</li>
<li>limited dexterity / movement</li>
<li>limited / different cognition</li>
<li>limited / no speech</li>
</ul>
<p>People with disabilities generally want to complete the same goals. It's just that they may approach them differently. For example, they might complete their goal using additional tools and technologies.</p>
<p>Understanding which specific details make accessibility its own subject area makes you a much better designer. Remembering that people with disabilities want to get on with their lives like we all do!</p>

<h2>Assistive technology</h2>
<p>Assistive technology is something that helps a person to complete a task or goal. Long-standing examples of such technology include: glasses for people who need to see more clearly, email helping X Y Z...</p>
<p>In digital accessibility, the following are well known examples of assistive technology:</p>
<h3>Switch devices, adapted keyboards, head wands, sip and puff devices</h3>
<p>This technology helps people with limited dexterity or body movement complete tasks.</p>
<h3>Screen reading technology</h3>
<p>This technology translates website content (and metadata) into audible announcements. This primarily helps people with low or no vision but may be used by others - for example people might use a screen reader as they benefit from or prefer to have information read out rather than reading it from a screen.</p>
<h3>Screen magnification software</h3>
<p>This technology magnifies website content to make it easier for people with low vision. The technology may also include features that allow someone to customise interface colours and may also include screen reading functions too.</p>
<h3>Voice recognition software</h3>
<p>This technology allows someone to speak commands using their voice to both interact with and navigate websites and apps. People may use this techology because they have limited or no upper body movement. But, people might use the technology because they can't or don't want to interact using their hands. For example, this type of voice-based interacting could be useful for a new parent holding their baby.</p>
