  <h1>Top accessibility anti-patterns</h1>
<p>Where any processes or tasks lead to negative outcomes, this phenomenon may be referred to as an 'anti-pattern'.</p>
<p>I have focussed on anti-patterns seen in the corporate accessiblity world, specifically, and what I write is just based on my experience.</p>
<p>Hopefully this helps you to spot anti-patterns emerging wherever you are and prevent or reduce the impact from them.</p>
<h2>Last minute accessibility</h2>
<p>Only working on accessibility in the last stages of a project.</p>
<p>Common examples include reacting to:</p>
<ul>
<li>having received a complaint</li>
<li>a looming regulatory or compliance deadline.</li>
</ul>
<p>This anti-pattern is top because it is so pervasive across organisations. Accessibility is still too often seen as a problem to be fixed not an opportunity (it's both, essentially).</p>
<p>This reactive or last minute approach simply doesn't produce results as graceful and effective as when accessibility has been considered and acted on from the beginning — or at least the early phases.</p>
<h3>Why the anti-pattern is bad</h3>
<p>Many organisations launch a new design system and then shortly after check its accessibility. The issue is lots of important design decisions will have already been made at this point and any changes needed can seldom be made easily.</p>
<p>Another important consideration is certain changes can't be made in isolation without affecting the whole.</p>
<p>Imagine the colour scheme in a new design system includes a key style: white text on a pale orange background. This won't be easy to read for most people and accessibility tests would confirm this.</p>
<p>In this example, this colour issue has only been tested and proven to be an issue <em>after</em> the design system launch. This means there's insufficient time for a designer to create wholesale changes to the design system. Instead they need to crowbar in crude solutions — for example, using drop shadows behind text or creating new tints of colours that have not been formally signed off.</p>
<p>The design system example described is 'bolt-on' accessibility.</p>
<p>It's a particularly nasty anti-pattern because the more of these slightly crude design tricks used, the less likely it is that designers — or anyone with visual sensitivity — will seek accessibility input next time around.</p>
<p>The vicious cycle has begun.</p>
<h3>What to do instead</h3>
<p>Consider accessibility as early as possible. Bring expertise in and see it as a means to improve quality and opportunities for innovation.</p>
<p>Do not wait until risk reduction alone is the motivation.</p>
<h2>Leaving accessibility to one person</h2>
<p>Often passionate individuals take on an informal role for accessibility.</p>
<p>The corporate world generally hasn't understood accessibility and so hasn't created the space and budget for formal roles.</p>
<p>But, accessibility is not a discrete 'thing' a single person can 'do'.</p>
<p>To succeed, accessibility must woven throughout various disciplines, organisational areas and activities. IT security is not a wholly unreasonable comparison, here. In that in security everyone has a role to play in its success and it should be thought about and integrated at various levels.</p>
<p>The outcomes for accessibility and IT security are quite different, that said!</p>
<h3>Why the anti-pattern is bad</h3>
<p>Leaving accessibility to one person creates a single point of dependency — and so often leads to failure.</p>
<p>It limits ability to enact real change or influence in an organisation.</p>
<p>The person is a high risk of leaving the organisation through burnout — if they do, they likely take with them important knowledge and skills.</p>
<h3>What to do instead</h3>
<p>Start to engage various teams and individuals across your organisation in accessibility activity.</p>
<p>Starting a Champions Network can be effective initiative to help share workload and create momentum.</p>
<p>You will probably want to bring in <em>proven</em> accessibility expertise to support earlier efforts, too — be this through contractors or specialist accessibility agencies.</p>
<h2>Having an accessible design system but not using it</h2>
<p>Do you have a design system?</p>
<p>Has accessibility been robustly integrated?</p>
<p>Yes? Your next goal is to get everyone using it. Make sure you have an effective way to track and measure usage of the system.</p>
<p>A surprising number of organisations have done lots of the hard work proving their design system is usable and accessible only to find people aren't using it.</p>
<h3>Why the anti-pattern is bad</h3>
<p>Here's an example I've seen a few times:</p>
<p>A new senior leader in marketing joins the organisation. They want to make an impact so create a high profile marketing campaign. The senior leader also brings in a new external partner — a creative agency who creates a new visual toolkit.</p>
<p>This new (un-tested) toolkit is used to build new website and digital assets. The existing accessible design system is not used.</p>
<p>The result? Users experience accessibility barriers — in some cases are completely blocked — and the campaign under-delivers.</p>
<p>In my talk: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HyC1gGSXPcA">Building Inclusive Health Services (YouTube)</a> there are similar (real) stories about the NHS and GOV.UK design systems.</p>
<h3>What to do instead</h3>
<p>First, make your design system accessible. Test it rigourously.</p>
<p>Include people with disabilities in the initial design of the system and then again for the ongoing improvements and updates to the system.</p>
<p>Now use it as much as possible — across your organisation products and services.</p>
<p>Have a plan to make sure updates and contributions to the system are accessible.</p>
<p>Keep the system accessible.</p>
<p>Create a communications and integration plan for your system — consider how it could be used by partners, suppliers, 3rd-parties who are not inside the organisation.</p>
<h2>Running an automated tool and only fixing those issues</h2>
<p>Running automated tools to find accessibility issues is a good start — you're making proactive steps to measure your accessibility status. But you should do more.</p>
<h3>Why the anti-pattern is bad</h3>
<p>Automated tools only find about 20-35% of the total testable issues (at the time of writing). So while some tests are better than none, your results will lead to overconfidence.</p>
<p>The free mass market versions of automated tools often work with your live web pages only. So the issues you find are probably already presenting barriers to your users. To avoid this, you also need to test before content is live.</p>
<p>Increasingly, tools not only find issues but claim to fix them, too. Advertising and marketing related to these tools will . These tools are often called 'overlays'. <a href="https://overlayfactsheet.com/en/">The evidence that these claims are false or highly misleading is overwhelming</a>.</p>
<h3>What to do instead</h3>
<p>How do you avoid this anti-pattern of relying on automated tools?</p>
<ul>
<li>also complete manual tests — testing little and often throughout a project, start-end</li>
<li>look at the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.2 (WCAG) and start to understand how to test against these guidelines
<ul>
<li>there are various <a href="https://www.getstark.co/wcag-explained/perceivable/">'plain language' versions of WCAG 2.2</a> and <a href="https://youtu.be/HtTyRajRuyY?si=wyQqLessqpk02AoL">helpful videos about manual accessibility testing</a> online, if you're finding things confusing</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>User research</h4>
<p>Plus, make sure you're doing user research. Get real and representative users — in particular users with disabilities to use your product or service. The insights from this research will help you avoid introducing accessibility barriers into your product.</p>
<p>There is no equivalent <em>or alternative</em> to this activity.</p>
<h2>Not validating 3rd-party accessibility claims</h2>
<p>You will at some point need to use 3rd-parties — such as agencies, vendors and software solutions. Many make quite bold claims about their make about their accessibility capability.</p>
<h3>Why the anti-pattern is bad</h3>
<p>While there are great partners and vendors out there, it's up to you to make sure you are taking the right steps to validate their claims. If you don't, you could find you have a significant risk introduced to your organisation.</p>
<p>As mentioned before, it's particularly important to fact check claims vendors of overlay tools make about their ability to identify and fix accessibility issues.</p>
<h3>What to do instead</h3>
<p>Complete an analysis of any claims potential partners make relating to accessibility. Part of this work should be to ask for evidence against any claims. This helps puts you in the best position to work our what activity to keep in house.</p>
<p>The analysis should also include a section that shows you have understood the trade-offs and risks associated with outsourcing work. Is outsourcing the best option?</p>
<p>Do you have an accessibility policy? Does it clearly defined what accessibility standards suppliers need to meet. Make sure this accessibility policy information is used in any contractural discussions with partners.</p>
